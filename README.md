# ParametricSpeaker

## Overview
This is a repository for the design of a parametric speaker, which uses ultrasonic waves to AM modulate audible sound and emit it with high directionality.  
The content is explained in the video below, so please check it out as well.

## AM Modulation Board (01_MC1496)
This is a board that performs AM modulation using the MC1496 IC.  
The carrier wave input supports both a sine wave from a function generator (FG) and a square wave generated by a microcontroller.  
The power supply input is designed for ±12V.

### Design Modifications
- **R8, 9, 10, 11**  
  Changed to 100Ω. Due to in-house component stock availability.
- **R7**  
  Stack two 100Ω resistors to create 50Ω.  
  Due to in-house component stock availability.
- **R13**  
  Changed to 220Ω.  
  For adjusting the amplifier gain.
- **RV1**  
  The value is almost fixed, so a variable resistor is not necessary. Use two 22kΩ resistors to create a voltage divider.
- **RV2**  
  Changed to a 50kΩ variable resistor.  
  For adjusting the amplifier gain.

## Amplifier Board (02_AMP)
This board amplifies the modulated wave using an LM1875.  
The power supply voltage is rated for up to ±30V, but when driving 30 ultrasonic speakers, it continuously consumes about 7W. Careful attention must be paid to heat generation.  
It will also work fine with around ±15V, but you will need to adjust the amplifier's gain accordingly.  

### Design Modifications
- **R5**  
  This is not populated, as a variable resistor will be installed instead.
- **R6**  
  A 50kΩ variable resistor is populated here.
- **R3**  
  Changed to 220Ω.
- **C1**  
  Only the top-side footprint for C1 is populated. Changed to a 1uF, 1206 size capacitor.
- **C6**  
  Changed to a 10uF, 1206 MLCC.

## Speaker Array Board (03_SpeakerArray)
This is a speaker array board where 30 ultrasonic speakers are arranged in parallel.  
There are provisions to add a resistor and capacitor in series with each speaker (these were not used in the actual build).  
Please pay attention to the polarity of the speakers. This is to ensure all piezoelectric elements bend in the same direction when voltage is applied.
